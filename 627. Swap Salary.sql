/*
Given a table salary, such as the one below, that has m=male and f=female values. Swap all f and m values (i.e., change all f values to m and vice versa) with a single update statement and no intermediate temp table.

Note that you must write a single update statement, DO NOT write any select statement for this problem.

 

Example:

| id | name | sex | salary |
|----|------|-----|--------|
| 1  | A    | m   | 2500   |
| 2  | B    | f   | 1500   |
| 3  | C    | m   | 5500   |
| 4  | D    | f   | 500    |
*/

UPDATE salary
SET SEX  = CASE
    when SEX = 'f' then 'm'
    WHEN sex = 'm' then 'f'
end
